# RandomMusicPlayer
Testing out Selenium webdriver by making a script that randomly plays Salman Khan songs

You will require a Python environment to run the code. Names of a few songs are already extracted and stored in the csv file, so the namesExtractor script is not required to be executed. 
The chromedriver executable is added in the repository. Update it if you have a newer version of chrome and make the necessary changes in your code.
A pretty simple script that doesn't do much but play his songs randomly.
